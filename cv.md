## Experience
- HF band signal classifier (support, modernization and refactoring huge legacy code). The classifier allows to
detect more than 150 types of signals and accurately determine their parameters;
- classifier of VHF signals using both standard DSP signal analysis algorithms and XGBoost library capabilities;
- detector of speech signals using Keras;
- module of accelerated detection Link 11, Stanag 4285; various Rohde & Schwarz and MIL-STD-188-110 modems;
- program for testing the work of various signal classifiers, comparison and evaluation of the results of their use
- module for creating and editing a dataset of signals for training neural networks and testing classification libraries
- 2 modules for searching for frequency hopping signals: the first using DSP algorithms, second using analysis images of signal spectrograms. Modules allow you to define a frequency grid
of signal and parameters of parcels;
- software protection using Guardant (writing protection algorithms with the use of various functions and key modifications);
- library for using IPP Library functions and extending its capabilities;
- library for access and management XML-table of different signals.
